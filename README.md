This was made with NestJS+Firebase+Tesseract and it will schedule the meals in our UFSM's restaurant. This project has a angular [front-end](https://github.com/danieldspx/ufsmbot-ng) as well, but the back-end it the one I love most since it uses this magical thing called Tesseract. And I used it to learn RxJS once and for all.

I loved this project and it has cool animations, so I will leave it here.

I like this project because it seems complicated, but it is fairly simple. And it was made in C, so it gives a false impression that I speak the language of the gods.
